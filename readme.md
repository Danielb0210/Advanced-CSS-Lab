Recommendations:

Try to use as little custom CSS as possible. Rely on Bootstrap as much as you can â€“ until you can't.
Break up the resume into sections, and tackle each section in "rows".
Use your own content (information, work experience, etc.) and continue to morph this into your own personal resume.
